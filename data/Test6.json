Over the past three months, I have been experiencing increasing stiffness in my wrists and lower back pain, which I believe is directly related to my current desk setup. As we enter tax season, my hours at the computer are expected to increase to 50+ hours per week, and I am worried this will exacerbate the issue.</p><p>I have tried adjusting my current chair, but the lumbar support is broken. Additionally, my monitor is fixed at a height that forces me to look down, straining my neck. I would like to request a standing desk converter and an ergonomic keyboard, similar to what the design team received last month.</p><p>I understand that any equipment purchase over $200 requires a manager's approval. I have already spoken to my manager, Sarah, and she supports this request, provided it is recommended by a health professional. I have attached a note from my physiotherapist recommending these specific modifications.</p><p>Please let me know the next steps to process this order before the heavy workload begins next week.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Michael Ross</p>"

However, it wasn't until 1881 that a serious attempt was made by the French, led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal. De Lesseps estimated the project would take six years and cost $214 million. However, he severely underestimated the geography; unlike the flat desert of Suez, Panama was a rugged jungle with a mountainous spine. The French attempt eventually went bankrupt in 1889 after burning through $287 million and losing an estimated 22,000 men to accidents and disease.</p><p><strong>B.</strong> The United States took over the project in 1904, following a controversial political maneuver. President Theodore Roosevelt, keen to expand American naval power, supported Panamanian rebels in their independence movement against Colombia. In exchange for military backing, the newly independent Panama granted the U.S. creating the \"Panama Canal Zone.\" This gave the U.S. sovereign control over a strip of land 10 miles wide for perpetuity (a clause later revoked in 1977).</p><p><strong>C.</strong> The American success where the French failed was largely due to the efforts of Dr. William Gorgas. Realizing that yellow fever and malaria were transmitted by mosquitoes—a recently discovered fact—Gorgas implemented a massive sanitation program. He ordered the draining of swamps, the installation of screens on windows, and the fumigation of homes. This aggressive eradication campaign reduced the death rate from tropical diseases significantly, allowing the workforce (mostly from the West Indies) to complete the massive engineering feat of the locks and the Culebra Cut by 1914.</p><p><strong>D.</strong> Today, the Panama Canal remains a vital artery of global trade, handling about 5% of worldwide shipping. In 2016, a massive expansion project was completed to accommodate \"Neo-Panamax\" ships, which can carry three times the cargo of older vessels. Despite this, the canal faces a new threat: climate change. The locks operate using freshwater from Gatun Lake, and recent droughts have lowered water levels, forcing authorities to restrict the weight of ships passing through, which disrupts global supply chains.</p>"

Instead, they are screened by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and increasingly, advanced AI algorithms. This shift has ignited a debate about fairness, efficiency, and the dehumanization of work.</p><p>HR Tech consultant Leo Varga champions AI as a tool for meritocracy. \"Humans are inherently biased,\" Varga argues. \"We unconsciously favor candidates who went to our university or share our hobbies.\" He claims that well-programmed AI focuses purely on skills and experience, stripping away markers of race, gender, or social class. Furthermore, Varga notes the sheer volume necessity; without AI, recruiters would be drowning in applications, leading to slower hiring and missed talent. \"It is not about replacing humans; it is about finding the needle in the haystack instantly,\" he asserts.</p><p>However, sociologist Dr. Arlene Foster calls this a dangerous myth. \"Algorithms are not neutral; they are opinions embedded in code,\" Foster warns. She points to the \"cloning effect\": if an AI is trained on data from a company's current top performers (who might be predominantly white males), it will penalize resumes that deviate from that pattern. Foster argues that this tech creates an \"opaque\" barrier where candidates are rejected for unknown reasons with no recourse. \"We are automating nepotism under the guise of science,\" she contends.</p><p>Legal analyst Mark Thorne adds that privacy is the next battleground. Some new tools analyze facial micro-expressions during video interviews to assess \"culture fit.\" Thorne considers this pseudoscience and a violation of civil rights. \"Judging a candidate's anxiety levels via camera is not objective data; it is digital phrenology,\" he states.</p>"
