As you know, we were short-staffed due to the holiday rush, and your failure to show up placed a significant burden on the rest of the team.</p><p>I checked the 'Shift Swap' log in the break room, and there is no record of you trading this shift with anyone. When I called you at 12:30 PM, you mentioned that you had 'verbally agreed' with Dave to switch days. However, as stated in the Employee Handbook (Page 12), <em>\"All shift changes must be signed by both parties and approved by a manager at least 24 hours in advance.\"</em></p><p>Since this protocol was not followed, this counts as a 'No Call / No Show.' This is your second infraction this month. A third infraction will result in automatic termination.</p><p>Please meet me in my office on Monday at 9:00 AM to sign the formal warning notice. If you have any text messages proving Dave agreed to cover you, please bring them, as that may mitigate the penalty, though it does not excuse the lack of manager approval.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Sarah</p>"

            "html_content": "<p><strong>A.</strong> The invention of the printing press is often attributed solely to Johannes Gutenberg in 15th-century Germany, but the history is more complex. Movable type—the concept of using individual characters to build pages—was actually invented in China by Bi Sheng around 1040 AD, utilizing fragile porcelain characters. Two centuries later, Koreans developed metal movable type. However, these Eastern innovations did not spark a mass revolution in literacy, largely because the Chinese and Korean writing systems required thousands of distinct characters, making typesetting a slow and laborious process compared to the simple 26-letter Roman alphabet.</p><p><strong>B.</strong> Gutenberg's genius lay not in the idea of the press itself, which was adapted from wine and olive presses, but in his synthesis of technologies. He developed a unique oil-based ink that adhered to metal, created a hand casting system to mass-produce letters cheaply, and utilized a wooden screw press mechanism. In 1455, he completed his masterpiece: the Gutenberg Bible. While aesthetically beautiful, the project was a financial disaster. Gutenberg was sued by his investor, Johann Fust, and lost control of his workshop just as the technology began to take off.</p><p><strong>C.</strong> The impact of the printing press on European society was explosive. Before 1450, books were hand-copied by monks, making them rare luxury items costing the equivalent of a house. By 1500, printing presses were operating in over 200 cities, producing millions of volumes. This drastic drop in cost democratized knowledge. It fueled the Protestant Reformation, as Martin Luther's theses could be printed and circulated rapidly, bypassing the Church's control of information. It also laid the groundwork for the Scientific Revolution by allowing researchers to share accurate data and diagrams.</p><p><strong>D.</strong> Despite its success, the spread of printing faced resistance. Scribes and illuminators rioted, fearing for their livelihoods. Governments and the Church instituted censorship laws to control the flow of \"heretical\" or \"seditious\" material. In 1501, Pope Alexander VI threatened excommunication for anyone printing books without approval. Nevertheless, the genie was out of the bottle. The ability to disseminate dissent cheaply meant that no central authority could ever fully control the public narrative again.</p>"
